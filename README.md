    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    
    User stories are a great way to establish the user needs and keep the development of the software user-focused. As developers,
    we tend do think of things in algorithmic or mathematical ways, but users typically do not think in this mentality. User stories
    bridge that gap by providing a formula for developers that reflect real-world expectations from the users of their products.
    
    How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    I think prior to this course, I adhered mostly to a waterfall style of code development. The principles of user focused design,
    transparency, and frequent communication with team mates are something I will incorporate into my future development work. I 
    will also make use of user stories for thinking about design and use story points for time estimations.
    
    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
    
    A good team member in software development communicates frequently and directly. A good team member is willing to work with others
    and is open to new experiences. A good team member understands their role on the team and assists others where they can.
